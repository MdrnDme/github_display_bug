🐛 **Does VS Code make you go postal? F*** yeah it does!**

I just documented one of the most infuriating bugs in modern development: VS Code's completely broken file change counter.

📊 **The Problem**: VS Code claimed "88 files changed" when I actually modified only 10 files. That's an 880% error rate.

This isn't just annoying - it's destroying real workflows:
• PR reviews become impossible to scope
• CI/CD pipelines get confused 
• Code reviews turn into guessing games
• Developers waste hours investigating phantom changes

🛠️ **The Solution**: I built actual tools that work while Microsoft figures their stuff out:
• Shell script for accurate git-based file counting
• Python workspace monitor for real-time tracking
• Installation scripts for easy setup

💡 **Why This Matters**: In large Flutter, React Native, or monorepo projects, accurate change tracking isn't optional - it's critical for team productivity and deployment safety.

I've open-sourced everything with battle-tested workarounds because we shouldn't have to tolerate broken tooling in 2025.
